# Bayesian Methods for Hackers Layout

\section{ Preamble}


\chapter1{ Introduction }

        
\chapter2{More PyMC / Modeling in PyMC}
    #flexible about what this section is. Basically it's more intro to the 
    syntax of PyMC, with examples + distributions.

\chapter3{ Intro to MCMC and Diagnogstics }
    
    
\chapter4{ The greatest theorem never told }
    #This is about the law of large numbers and how a bayesian uses it for estimates. 
 
    
    
\chapter5{ Would you rather lose an arm or a leg? }
  #Introduction to loss functions and point estimation.
