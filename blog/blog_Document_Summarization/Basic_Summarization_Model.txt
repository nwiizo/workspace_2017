To test the effectiveness of position informationin document summarization, we first propose a word-based summarization model for applying the position information. 

The system follows a typical extractive style that constructs the target
summary by selecting the most salient sentences.

Under the bag-of-words model, the probability of a word w in a document set D can be scaled by its frequency, i.e., p(w)=freq(w)/|D|,
where freq(w) indicates the frequency of w in D and |D| indicates the total number of words in D.

The probability of a sentence s={w1, …, wN} is then calculated as the product of the word probabilities, i.e., p(s)=Πi p(wi). 

Moreover, the probability of a summary consisting a set of sentences, denoted as S={s1, …, sM}, can be calculated by the product of the sentence
probabilities, i.e., p(S)=Πj p(sj). 

To obtain the optimum summary, an intuitive idea is to select the sentences to maximize the overall summary probability p(S), equivalent to maximizing
log(p(S)) = ΣjΣi log(p(wji)) = ΣjΣi (logfreq(wji)-log|D|) = ΣjΣi log freq(wji) - |S|·log |D|, where wji indicates the ith word in sj and |S| indicates the total number of words in S.

As to practical summarization tasks, a maximum summary length is usually postulated. 

So here we just assume that the length of the summary is fixed. 

Then, the above optimization target is equivalent to maximizing ΣjΣi logfreq(wji).

From the view of information theory, the sum can also be interpreted as a simple measure on the total information amount of the summary.

In this interpretation, the information of a single word wji is measured by log freq(wji) and the summary information is the sum of the word information.

 So the optimization target can also be interpreted as including the most informative words to form the most informative summary given the length limit.

In extractive summarization, summaries are composed by sentence selection. 

As to the above optimization target, the sentence scoring function for ranking the sentences should be calculated as the average word information, i.e.,
score(s) = Σi log freq(wi) / |s|.

After ranking the sentences by their ranking scores, we can select the sentences into the summary by the descending order of their score
until the length limit is reached. 

By this process, the summary with the largest p(S) can be composed.
