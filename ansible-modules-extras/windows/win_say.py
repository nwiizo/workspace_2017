module: win_say
version_added: "2.3"
short_description: Text to speech module for Windows to speak messages and optionally play sounds
description:
    - Uses .NET libraries to convert text to speech and optionally play .wav sounds.  Audio Service needs to be running and some kind of speakers or headphones need to be attached to the windows target(s) for the speech to be audible.
options:
  msg:
    description:
      - The text to be spoken.  Use either msg or msg_file.  Optional so that you can use this module just to play sounds.
    required: false
    default: none
  msg_file:
    description:
      - Full path to a windows format text file containing the text to be spokend.  Use either msg or msg_file.  Optional so that you can use this module just to play sounds.
    required: false
    default: none
  voice:
    description:
      - Which voice to use. See notes for how to discover installed voices.  If the requested voice is not available the default voice will be used. Example voice names from Windows 10 are 'Microsoft Zira Desktop' and 'Microsoft Hazel Desktop'.
    required: false
    default: system default voice
  speech_speed:
    description:
      - How fast or slow to speak the text.  Must be an integer value in the range -10 to 10.  -10 is slowest, 10 is fastest.
    required: false
    default: 0
  start_sound_path:
    description:
      - Full path to a C(.wav) file containing a sound to play before the text is spoken.  Useful on conference calls to alert other speakers that ansible has something to say.
    required: false
    default: null
  end_sound_path:
    description:
      - Full path to a C(.wav) file containing a sound to play after the text has been spoken.  Useful on conference calls to alert other speakers that ansible has finished speaking.
    required: false
    default: null
author: "Jon Hawkesworth (@jhawkesworth)"
notes: 
   - Needs speakers or headphones to do anything useful.
   - To find which voices are installed, run the following powershell
     Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Speech
     $speech = New-Object -TypeName System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer
     $speech.GetInstalledVoices() | ForEach-Object { $_.VoiceInfo }
     $speech.Dispose()
   - Speech can be surprisingly slow, so its best to keep message text short.
