description:
    - Gather facts about ec2 security groups in AWS.
version_added: "2.3"
author: "Henrique Rodrigues (github.com/Sodki)"
options:
  filters:
    description:
      - A dict of filters to apply. Each dict item consists of a filter key and a filter value. See \
      U(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeSecurityGroups.html) for \
      possible filters. Filter names and values are case sensitive. You can also use underscores (_) \
      instead of dashes (-) in the filter keys, which will take precedence in case of conflict.
    required: false
    default: {}
notes:
  - By default, the module will return all security groups. To limit results use the appropriate filters.
