All the book's examples are designed to be educational, and many are
also designed to be useful. I hope that you find them helpful, and are
perhaps able to use some of them as starting points for your own
projects.

Most of the icons are from Debian (e.g., GNOME, Tango, and Oxygen) and
so are open source licensed. (Visit http://www.debian.org/

Here is the list of programs referred to in the book grouped by chapter.
Dependencies on third-party packages are listed in []s with URLs at the
end. All the examples work with Python 3.3+ and many with 3.2 and 3.1.

Third-party packages:
    Modern package managers:
	(1) Grab the file: http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
	(2) In a console execute:
		$ python distribute_setup.py
		$ easy_install pip
	    Note you may have to give a path on windows, e.g.,
		C:\> c:\python33\python c:\Users\<Username>\Downloads\distribute_setup.py
		C:\> c:\python33\scripts\easy_install pip
