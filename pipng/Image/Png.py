    import Image
Use the above rather than importing this module explicitly. This works
because Image imports any modules it finds (to allow for new image
processing modules to be added post-facto).

This Image plugin module can read and write .png files if PyPNG is
installed. See http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypng
